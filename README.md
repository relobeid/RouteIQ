# RouteIQ: Intelligent Traffic Management System

Real-time traffic optimization platform that leverages machine learning and distributed systems to reduce urban congestion by up to 25%.

## The Problem

Urban traffic congestion costs the US economy over $166 billion annually. Traditional traffic management systems are reactive rather than predictive, leading to inefficient route planning and poor utilization of traffic data.

## Our Solution

RouteIQ processes live traffic data using Google Cloud Platform to provide intelligent routing recommendations:

- **Predictive Traffic Analysis**: ML models forecast congestion patterns
- **Real-time Route Optimization**: Dynamic algorithms adapt to live conditions  
- **High-Volume Data Processing**: Handles 10,000+ data points per hour
- **Interactive Visualization**: Live traffic heatmaps and analytics

## Technology Stack

**Backend**: Go • AlloyDB • BigQuery • VertexAI • Cloud Run  
**Frontend**: Next.js • TypeScript • Mapbox • Tailwind CSS  
**Infrastructure**: Docker • Pub/Sub • WebSockets

## Architecture

```
Traffic Simulation → Go API → AlloyDB → BigQuery → VertexAI

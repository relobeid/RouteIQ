## Daily Accountability

### Progress Tracking
Each session should result in:
1. **Commit to Git**: Working code with clear commit messages
2. **Test Results**: All testing metrics documented and verified
3. **Demo Ready**: Functional demonstration of new features
4. **Documentation**: Updated README with progress and next steps

### Blocker Management
If any session exceeds planned time by >50%:
1. Document the blocker and root cause
2. Adjust subsequent session scope if needed
3. Consider alternative implementation approaches
4. Prioritize core MVP features over polish

### Quality Gates
Before moving to next session:
- [ ] All tests pass and coverage targets met
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and standards
- [ ] Feature works end-to-end in local environment
- [ ] No critical bugs or performance regressions
